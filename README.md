# Single-Layer-Perceptron-Task1
Single layer perceptron using Signum activation function on penguins' data set

## Task Overview
- Single layer neural networks which can be able to classify a stream of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.
- Use the penguins data in both your training and testing processes. (Each class has 50 samples: train NN with 30 non-repeated samples randomly selected, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)

## Dataset (Penguins)
- The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Penguins (Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap).  
- Five features were measured from each sample: bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length, gender and body_mass, (in millimeter).
